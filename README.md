![Documentation Status](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/oldlspec?style=flat-square)
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/erayerdin/oldl?style=flat-square)

OLDL is a data language just like JSON, YAML or TOML but the data is represented on one line.

It tries to set a standard where the user provides a data on one-line. It is supposed to be human-writable as well as human-readable.

An example would be:

```plain
batman genre:thriller,action year:2000..2005 order:+released stars:>3
```
